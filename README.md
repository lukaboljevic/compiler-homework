# Compiler homework

This homework was part of the subject "Programski prevodioci",
or as everybody tends to call it, "Kompajleri".

As of now, this homework includes the implementation
of the Scanner (Lexical Analyzer) and Parser (Syntax Analyzer).
It is not the best code I've ever written, and I can't say
I'm 100% proud of it, but it will do just fine for the purposes
of the final exam. Don't judge. I will add the complete grammar
later.
